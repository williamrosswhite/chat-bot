### To Do

```
- figure out how to have an intermediary staging mode
    - had to usurp production in vue to deploy online, i'd still like to have a third local mode which runs a built version of vue in backend's wwwroot and runs it all bundled together locally, but apparently i'll have to create a new mode for vue as there is only development and production out of the box
- figure out how to automatically deploy created front end build files into the backend's wwwroot folder
```
