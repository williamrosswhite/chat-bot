# backend

## General Info
```
- more complete information can be found here in the [Main README](../README.md)
- to run the back end in local development mode, navigate to ./chatbot/backend and run `dotnet run --launch-profile Development` (or `dotnet watch run --launch-profile Development` to hot reload)
- to run the back end within the backend as static files, navigate to ./chatbot/backend and run `dotnet run --launch-profile Staging` (or `dotnet watch run --launch-profile Staging` to hot reload)
* launching backend in development mode through debugger will automatically use 'watch run'
